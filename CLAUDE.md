## CRITICAL: Do Not Change Design Without Permission

- **NEVER change product design/UX without explicit user request**
- Bug fix and design change are completely different things
- If you identify a "potential improvement" or "UX issue", only REPORT it - do NOT implement
- When user says "fix it", fix only the BUGS, not your suggestions
- If you think design change is needed, ASK FIRST before implementing
- Violating this rule wastes user's time and breaks trust

## Build Guidelines

- **IMPORTANT: Only build when the user explicitly requests it**
- Never run build commands automatically after code changes
- Never run build commands to "verify" or "check" code
- Do not use `cargo build`, `python3 build.py`, or any build commands unless user asks
- Focus only on code modifications; user handles all builds manually

## Version Management

- Version is defined in `Cargo.toml` (line 3: `version = "x.x.x"`)
- All version displays use `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` macro to read from Cargo.toml
- To update version: only modify `Cargo.toml`, all other locations reflect automatically
- Never hardcode version strings in source code
